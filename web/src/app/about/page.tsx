              <div className="space-y-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                <p>
                  AB Jail is an open-source, community-led transparency project for political fundraising. Donors – especially elderly small-dollar givers – are being bombarded with deceptive texts and emails that erode trust and poison the well for everyone. AB Jail shines a light on these practices by accepting submissions and monitoring real-time feeds: Forward suspicious emails to <code className="bg-secondary px-1 py-0.5 rounded text-xs font-mono">submit@abjail.org</code>, upload screenshots, or paste text, and AI extracts the sender, flags likely violations of ActBlue&apos;s own published rules, generates a ready-to-send report, and adds the case to a public ledger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, AB Jail continuously monitors messages from seeded phone numbers and email addresses subscribed to campaigns, PACs, and list sellers, creating a real-time feed of fundraising solicitations that builds our public database. This two-pronged approach – manual submission and automatic collection – ensures comprehensive coverage of deceptive practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The goal is to protect donors and safeguard small-dollar fundraising by making patterns public. The entire project is open-source and community-driven – anyone can audit the <a href="https://github.com/ryanmio/ActBlue-Jail#" className="text-primary hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code</a> or contribute improvements directly.

                  <p>
                    AB Jail is an open-source, community-led transparency project that documents potential fundraising policy violations. The site is for research, journalism, and public accountability. It is not a court of law and it does not adjudicate facts.

                  <p>
                    AB Jail is not affiliated with ActBlue, ActBlue Civics, ActBlue Charities, Numero, NGP, ClickToWin, or any campaign, PAC, nonprofit, platform, vendor, or payment processor mentioned on this site. References to third-party names, policies, trademarks, or products are for identification and reporting purposes only and do not imply endorsement or association.

                  <p>
                    Materials on this site may include user uploads and messages received by AB Jail via seeded &ldquo;honeytrap&rdquo; phone numbers and email addresses. AB Jail uses automated tools to extract text, identify senders, and label potential policy issues. Automated labels are probabilistic, may be incomplete or incorrect, and should be treated as leads for further review – not as definitive findings.

Unless expressly stated, AB Jail does not assert that any person or entity violated a law or regulation. Descriptions and summaries are presented as opinions based on disclosed facts – namely the quoted message content, links, and screenshots included in each case.

                    Where the site generates a prefilled email or other draft to help users report a case to a platform, that draft is a convenience feature. AB Jail does not submit reports on a user&apos;s behalf in the MVP, does not guarantee any outcome, and does not represent any user before any platform or authority.
