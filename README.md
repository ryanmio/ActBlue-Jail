# AB Jail

AB Jail is an open-source project that brings transparency to political fundraising through AI-powered analysis and real-time monitoring. 

**Submit manually:** Forward emails to submit@abjail.org, paste text directly, or upload screenshots of deceptive messages. AI extracts senders, checks against ActBlue's rules, drafts reports, and adds cases to a public ledger.

**Monitor automatically:** Seeded phone numbers and email addresses continuously collect fundraising solicitations from campaigns, PACs, and list sellers, creating a real-time feed that builds our database.
