# AB Jail

AB Jail is an open-source project that brings transparency to political fundraising. The tool allows dragging and dropping screenshots of deceptive texts or emails, where AI extracts the sender, checks against ActBlue's rules, drafts a report, and logs it publicly. Messages from seeded phone numbers are automatically collected to build a real-time feed of these solicitations.

## Structure

- **Frontend**: Pages for viewing cases, uploading screenshots, and an evaluation system to rate AI accuracy.
- **API Routes**: Handle uploads, OCR for text extraction, AI classification of violations, report generation, and moreâ€”like screenshotting landing pages or processing inbound SMS.
- **Database**: Schemas for reports, comments, and evaluations, with SQL migrations.
- **AI Integration**: Server-side logic for classifying messages and identifying senders.
- **Components**: UI elements for breadcrumbs, headers, animations, and a landing page scanner.
